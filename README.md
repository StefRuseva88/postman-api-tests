## Installation and Usage

### Postman

**Postman** is a popular tool used to test APIs by making HTTP requests to various endpoints. To use Postman:

1. Download and install Postman from the [official website](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).
2. Open Postman and create a new request by selecting the HTTP method and entering the endpoint URL.
3. Add necessary headers, parameters, and body data.
4. Click on the "Send" button to make the request and view the response.

You can also import the provided Postman collections in this repository by selecting `Import` in Postman and uploading the collection file.

### Newman

**Newman** is a command-line collection runner for Postman. It allows you to run and test Postman collections directly from the command line. To install and use Newman:

1. Install Node.js from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/).
2. Install Newman using npm:

   ```sh
   npm install -g newman
   ```
3. Run a Postman collection using Newman:

   ```sh
   newman run path/to/your/collection.json
   ```

- You can also generate HTML reports:

  ```sh
  newman run path/to/your/collection.json -r htmlextra
  ```

### Swagger
**Swagger** is an open-source tool that helps you design, build, document, and consume RESTful web services. To use Swagger:

- Access the Swagger UI by navigating to the Swagger endpoint URL, typically provided by the API you are testing.
- Use the Swagger UI to explore and interact with the API endpoints.
- View the detailed API documentation, including the available endpoints, request parameters, and response formats.
